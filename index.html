        <div class="personal-info">
            <p><strong>I am Jezreel Hope Molina Ciervo</strong>, 28 years old, single, and currently working at IBM Business Services Inc. as a U.S. Payroll Trainer and Lead Quality Analyst during the night shift (11 PM to 8 AM Manila Time). I am also studying at Bethel Bible College, pursuing a Bachelor of Christian Ministries degree with a major in Pastoral Leadership.</p>

            <p>I am the breadwinner of my family, living with my mother and sister. My sister is a 3rd-year Computer Science student, while my mother works part-time as a real estate agent.</p>

            <p>In 2023, during a church event, the Lord called me to know Him more and serve in ministry. Despite financial challenges, I decided to follow His calling, trusting in His provision.</p>

            <p>In July 2024, I enrolled at Bethel Bible College to deepen my knowledge of God. This journey is shaping me as a minister, ensuring my sermons align with His will.</p>

            <p>Though I have a stable job, our family is experiencing financial constraints as I pursue my studies. Since this is my second bachelor's degree, I am now completing the necessary units.</p>

            <p><strong>Current Semester:</strong> January - May 2025</p>

            <p>I am walking by faith and reaching out for support to continue my studies. My tuition fee for this semester is <strong>₱13,300</strong>, which I am paying in installments.</p>

            <p>Integrity is essential to me, and I am open to providing any further details regarding my expenses.</p>
