        <h1>Jezreel Hope M. Ciervo.</h1>
        <div class="personal-info">
            <p><strong></strong> I am Jezreel Hope Molina Ciervo, 28 years old, single, and currently working at IBM Business Services Inc. as a U.S. Payroll Trainer and Lead Quality Analyst during the night shift (11 PM to 8 AM Manila Time). I am also studying at Bethel Bible College during the day, pursuing a Bachelor of Christian Ministries degree with a major in Pastoral Leadership.</p>

            <p><strong></strong>I would like to share some personal information so you can get to know me better. I am the breadwinner of my family and currently living with my mother and sister. My sister is a 3rd-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, while my mother works part-time as a real estate agent.</p>

            <p><strong></strong>My family and I are fully committed to serving the Lord in our local church, Jesus Our Living Hope Christian Family Church, located on the 2nd floor of Ramos Building, Deparo Road, Bagumbong, Caloocan City. The church is led by our senior pastor, Rev. Pastora Elmara Billones. I am part of the Pulpit Ministry as one of the preachers, the ministry head of the Young Adults’ Ministry, and the mainstay keyboardist for the Praise and Worship Team.</p>
            <img src="chateau.jpg" alt="My Photo">
            <p><strong></strong>In 2023, during one of our church events, the Lord undeniably called me to know Him more and serve Him in ministry. I accepted His call, fully aware of the challenges of following and serving Him, especially how it would impact our finances. I knew I would need to allocate a budget for my tuition fees, school allowances, and other expenses required for school activities.
I witnessed my father’s struggles as he led his church as a pastor, but I also saw the incredible faithfulness of the God he served. His example has only deepened my resolve to pursue my own calling, knowing that God is our ultimate provider. Reflecting on God’s greatness, I place my complete trust in Him. I believe wholeheartedly that He is the God of impossibilities, and with Him, all things are possible for those who believe (Mark 9:23).
